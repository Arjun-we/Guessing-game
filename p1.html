    <h1>Spectacular Spider-Man</h1>
    
    <p>The Spectacular Spider-Man is an American animated superhero television series developed by Victor Cook and Greg Weisman, based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. In terms of overall tone and style, the series is based primarily on the Stan Lee, Steve Ditko and John Romita Sr. era of The Amazing Spider-Man, with a similar balance of action, drama, and comedy as well as a high school setting. However, it also blends material from all eras of the comic's run up to that point in addition to other sources such as the Ultimate Spider-Man comics and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy. The Spectacular Spider-Man was jointly produced by Marvel Entertainment, Culver Entertainment, Adelaide Productions, and Sony Pictures Television. It premiered on March 8, 2008, during the Kids' WB programming block of The CW. The series aired its second season on Disney XD in the United States and ended its run on November 18, 2009. The entire series was broadcast in Canada on Teletoon. Although a total of five seasons consisting of 65 episodes was initially intended, the series was canceled by Sony after the second season.</p>
